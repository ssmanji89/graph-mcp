- **Application**: Future API integrations require comprehensive scope analysis upfront

### **Quality vs. Scope Trade-offs**
- **Learning**: Better to have excellent coverage of smaller scope than poor coverage of large scope
- **Impact**: Focus on tool quality and user experience over feature quantity
- **Application**: Depth-first approach for each tool category before expanding

### **Community Expectations**
- **Learning**: Clear communication about release scope prevents disappointment
- **Impact**: Tiered release strategy with clear progression plan
- **Application**: Transparent roadmap and regular progress communication
