## Notes

### Implementation Accelerated:
The project implementation has proceeded ahead of the original timeline due to:

2. Comprehensive planning and decision documentation
3. Reusable patterns and consistent implementation approach
4. Focus on quality over speed, resulting in fewer iterations

### Quality First Approach:
Priority placed on creating robust, production-ready code rather than minimum viable implementation:
- Comprehensive error handling from the start
- Performance optimization built-in
- Full type safety and validation
- Extensive logging and monitoring capabilities

This foundation provides a solid base for rapid feature expansion in Week 3 and beyond.
