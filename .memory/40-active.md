5. **Graph Client**: âœ… Complete - Graph API client wrapper with error handling
6. **Type System**: âœ… Complete - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
7. **Testing Framework**: âœ… Complete - Jest with mocking and test utilities
8. **Initial Tools**: âœ… Complete - list-users and get-user MCP tools implemented
9. **Logging Service**: âœ… Complete - Winston-based structured logging

### Active Priorities (Week 2)
1. **Additional MCP Tools**: ðŸ”„ Group management tools (list-groups, get-group, create-group)
2. **Resource Providers**: ðŸ”„ Graph data resources for organizational context
3. **Integration Testing**: ðŸ”„ End-to-end testing with real Graph API
4. **Error Recovery**: ðŸ”„ Advanced error handling and retry mechanisms
5. **Documentation**: ðŸ”„ API documentation and usage examples
