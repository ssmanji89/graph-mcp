# Project Charter: Microsoft Graph MCP Server

## What
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to seamlessly interact with Microsoft Graph API, providing secure and governed access to Microsoft 365 organizational data and services.

## Why
- **AI-Driven Productivity**: Enable AI agents to access and manipulate Microsoft 365 data for enhanced productivity
- **IT Administrator Efficiency**: Provide automated tools for user management, security analysis, and organizational insights
- **Power User Enablement**: Allow advanced users to leverage AI for complex organizational tasks
- **Security & Governance**: Maintain Microsoft's security model while enabling AI access

## Goals
### Primary Objectives
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Support all major Microsoft Graph API endpoints (Users, Groups, Teams, Sites, Security, etc.)
2. **Security First**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and audit logging
3. **Developer Experience**: Provide intuitive tools and resources for AI agents
4. **Enterprise Ready**: Support organizational deployment with governance controls
5. **Community Contribution**: Create open-source foundation for broader adoption

### Success Metrics
- Support for 80%+ of commonly used Graph API endpoints
- Authentication success rate >99%
- Response time <500ms for typical queries
- Zero security incidents in production deployments
- Active community contributions and adoption

## Constraints
### Technical
- Must comply with Microsoft Graph API rate limits and throttling
- Authentication must support multiple flows (delegated, application permissions)
- Must handle Microsoft Graph's complex permission model
- Security must meet enterprise standards

### Business
- Open source project requiring community engagement
- Must work within Microsoft's Graph API terms of service
- Should support both cloud and on-premises deployments where applicable

## Target Audience
1. **IT Administrators**: Seeking automation for user management, security monitoring, compliance reporting
2. **Power Users**: Business analysts, project managers, knowledge workers needing advanced data access
3. **Developers**: Building AI-powered applications that need Graph API integration
4. **Organizations**: Enterprises seeking to deploy AI tools while maintaining governance

## Project Scope
- **In Scope**: Core MCP server, authentication, major Graph API endpoints, documentation, deployment guides
- **Out of Scope**: Custom business logic, third-party integrations beyond Graph API, UI/frontend development
- **Future Considerations**: Advanced analytics, custom connectors, enterprise management tools
