# Decision Log: Microsoft Graph MCP Server

## ðŸš¨ **Tiered Release Strategy** (January 2025)

### Decision: Implement Staged Release Approach Starting with v0.1.0 Foundation
**Context**: After comprehensive analysis of Microsoft Graph OpenAPI v1.0 specifications, discovered current implementation covers only ~5% of total API surface area. Original plan assumed near-complete Graph coverage.

**Scope Reality Check**:
- Microsoft Graph contains 25+ major API domains (Users, Security, DeviceManagement, Files, etc.)
- Current implementation: 5 basic tools with limited operations
- Missing critical enterprise domains: Security (1.6MB), Identity.Governance (3.2MB), Files (3.0MB), etc.
- Publication as "comprehensive" Microsoft Graph server would be misleading

**Options Considered**:
1. **Delay publication until comprehensive** - 6+ months development, significant scope creep risk
2. **Publish current state as v1.0** - False advertising, poor user experience
3. **Tiered release strategy** - Clear progression with honest scope communication

**Choice**: Tiered release strategy with foundation-first approach

**Rationale**:
- **User Value**: Immediate value from solid foundation tools
- **Realistic Expectations**: Clear communication about current vs. future scope
- **Quality Focus**: Depth over breadth ensures excellent user experience
- **Community Building**: Earlier engagement with real users provides feedback
- **Sustainable Development**: Manageable scope prevents burnout and technical debt

**Impact**: 
- Changed timeline from 4-week publication to 6-month comprehensive platform
- v0.1.0 (Foundation) â†’ v0.2.0 (Productivity) â†’ v0.3.0 (Security) â†’ v0.4.0 (Infrastructure) â†’ v1.0.0 (Comprehensive)
- Clear roadmap communication prevents user disappointment
- Focus on tool quality over quantity in initial releases
